				At The Cinnamon Kitchen, we conduct workshops as an extension to our bakery kitchen and it’s philosophy. We wish to enable chefs, home cookies and healthy eating enthusiasts to be able to understand baking plant based ingredients, millets and nuts better and to empower them to create recipes that are healthy and delicious at the same time.Generative AI is transforming the ways creators express themselves – from storyboarding ideas to experimenting with tools that enhance the creative process.
